    <b>Project on Console</b>
    <p>Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.</p>
    <p>To view my project you have to open console, so just follow these steps :  use this keyboard shortcut: Cmd + Option + J (on a Mac) or Cmd +Shift +J (on Windows). As an alternative, you could right-click on the webpage and click "Inspect," and the developers window will appear. Click the "Console" tab in that window.</p>
